## Overview
I coded along with the tutorial to learn and practice sass for css. It's a very nice looking portfolio made using sass. Structure is overcomplicated simply to show more advanced structure of a full project with the use of sass.

## What I learned
I learned to use SASS in order to enhance CSS use for styling websites. I learned to:
- import external scss files (I know I should rather use @use or @forward instead of @import now)
- functions and variables
- @mixins and @includes 
- use of partials for better project structure (like _config.scss or _responsive.scss)
- nesting of classes
